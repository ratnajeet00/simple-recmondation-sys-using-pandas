# Movie Recommendation System

This is a simple movie recommendation system built in Python. It uses collaborative filtering to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. The system leverages user ratings of movies to provide personalized recommendations.

## Features

- Recommends movies based on user preferences.
- Uses cosine similarity to find similar users and suggest movies.
- Simple console-based interface.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x). The following Python packages are required:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```
Getting Started
Clone the Repository (or download the files):

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender.git
cd movie-recommender
```
Run the Application: Save the code provided in a file named movie_recommender.py, and run the script:
```
python movie_recommender.py
```
